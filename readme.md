# unkeyboard

This repo contains a [CadQuery](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/) script for generating a stacked acrylic case for [Atreus](https://atreus.technomancy.us/)-style keyboards. The case is inspired by the [62 key case](https://shop.profetkeyboards.com/product/atreus62-keyboard) but also supports the [42 key](https://atreus.technomancy.us/) and [44 key](https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus) variations. By default a [Chicago bolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_bolt) is used, a wider bezel around the keys, and has sharp corners where the original were curved. I intend to hand wire keyboards with these cases but they should also fit available [Atreus PCBs](https://shop.profetkeyboards.com/product/atreus62-pcb).
