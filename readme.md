# unkeyboard

This repo contains a [CadQuery](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/) script for generating stacked acrylic cases for [Atreus](https://atreus.technomancy.us/)-style keyboards. The case is inspired by the [62 key case](https://shop.profetkeyboards.com/product/atreus62-keyboard) but generating [42 key](https://atreus.technomancy.us/) and [44 key](https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus) variations is also supported. By default a [Chicago bolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_bolt) is used, a wider bezel is added around the keys, and sharp corners replace the curved corners of the original. Generated cases can be [hand wired](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/guides/keyboard-building/hand_wire) or used with [available PCBs](https://shop.profetkeyboards.com/product/atreus62-pcb).
